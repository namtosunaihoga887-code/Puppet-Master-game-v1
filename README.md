# Puppet Master Game

A physics-based ragdoll sandbox game where the player acts as an invisible controller (Puppet Master) who manipulates a cloth puppet using tools, forces, and environment interactions.

## Core Features
- Physics-driven ragdoll puppet with 6 body parts
- Exaggerated physics reactions
- Interactive tools and weapons
- Dark-humor cartoon-style visuals
- Mobile-friendly touch controls

## Game Concept
The fun and challenge come from unpredictable physics, exaggerated reactions, and dark-humor cartoon-style interactions. Players control the puppet indirectly through forces and tools rather than direct movement controls.

## Technical Stack
- Unity with 3D physics engine
- Ragdoll physics system
- Touch-based UI for mobile
