# 🎮 GAME DESIGN PROMPT  
## Game Title: Puppet Master

---

## 🧠 CORE CONCEPT
Create a **physics-based ragdoll sandbox game** where the player acts as an invisible controller (Puppet Master) who manipulates a cloth puppet using tools, forces, and environment interactions.  
The fun and challenge come from **unpredictable physics**, exaggerated reactions, and dark-humor cartoon-style interactions.

---

## 🎨 VISUAL STYLE
- 3D cartoon / stylized look  
- Puppet made of burlap / fabric (voodoo doll style)  
- Stitched smile, button or X-shaped eyes  
- Wooden plank background (wall / floor)  
- Slightly creepy but humorous  
- NO realistic gore or blood  

---

## 🧍 MAIN CHARACTER (PUPPET)
The puppet is a **fully physics-driven ragdoll**.

### Body Parts:
- Head  
- Torso  
- Left Arm  
- Right Arm  
- Left Leg  
- Right Leg  

### Technical Requirements:
- Each body part is a separate **rigidbody**  
- Connected using **hinge / configurable joints**  
- Gravity enabled  
- High elasticity for exaggerated movement  

---

## ⚙️ PHYSICS SYSTEM
- Real-time ragdoll physics  
- Strong gravity interaction  
- Limbs should swing, bend, twist, and fall naturally  
- Movement must feel chaotic but fun  

> The player NEVER controls the puppet with walk/run buttons.  
> The player ONLY applies forces or tools.

---

## 🎭 PLAYER ROLE
The player is the **Puppet Master**, not the puppet.

Player abilities:
- Drag limbs  
- Apply directional force  
- Rotate or throw the puppet  
- Pin the puppet to surfaces  
- Interact using tools  

---

## 🧰 TOOLS & WEAPONS
Include interactive tools such as:
- Knives  
- Nails  
- Hammers  
- Spikes  
- Guns (cartoon bullets only)  
- Fire or electricity (stylized effects)

### Rules:
- No realistic blood  
- Damage represented by:
  - Fabric tearing  
  - Stitch damage  
  - Holes in cloth  
  - Sound effects  
  - Facial expression changes  

---

## 💥 DAMAGE & REACTION SYSTEM
- Puppet reacts with:
  - Cartoon screams  
  - Shaking or flailing limbs  
  - Temporary ragdoll collapse  
  - Expression changes  

- No permanent death  
- Puppet can reset or regenerate  

---

## 📷 CAMERA SYSTEM
- Fixed top-down or slightly angled camera  
- Smooth zoom in/out  
- Camera shake on heavy impacts  

---

## 🔁 GAMEPLAY LOOP
1. Spawn puppet on wooden surface  
2. Player selects a tool  
3. Player interacts using tap / drag / hold  
4. Physics reacts unpredictably  
5. Score increases based on creative interaction  

---

## 🏆 SCORING SYSTEM
Points awarded for:
- Multiple hits  
- Airtime  
- Combo reactions  
- Environmental interactions  

Optional modes:
- Sandbox mode (no score)  
- Challenge mode  

---

## 🖥️ UI / UX
- Minimal interface  
- Tool icons on screen sides  
- Reset button  
- Slow-motion toggle  

---

## 🔊 AUDIO
- Cloth tearing sounds  
- Wood impact sounds  
- Cartoon pain sounds  
- Dark playful background music  

---

## 📱 PLATFORM
- Mobile-first design  
- Touch-based controls  
- Optimized physics performance  

---

## 🎭 EMOTIONAL TONE
- Dark humor  
- Stress-relief sandbox  
- Chaotic but playful  
- Not horror, not realistic violence  

---

## 🧠 FINAL DESIGN NOTE
Focus on **sandbox freedom, physics chaos, and exaggerated reactions** rather than story or linear progression.

> “This game represents control without responsibility — the illusion of power.”
